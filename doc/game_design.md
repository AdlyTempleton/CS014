# Design Doc for Wandering Bard

### Goals

Weed Strike is a fairly standard, simple roguelike. As such, the player gets
* character advancement/progression (on the mechanics side of things, not necessarily the story side)
  * some opponents that are too challenging to fight in the early stages of the game are easy to beat by the later stages of the game
* inventory management
* primary mob interactions are combat ('attack it' is never a bad choice from a story standpoint)
  * some tactically interesting combat
    * at the very least, players must make decisions about whether to fight or flee a given opponent
* exploration (of procedurally generated content)
* a simple framing story to engage the player and justify the avatar actions, but nothing to deep and little in the way of narrative progression
* a final battle/goal
* other standard roguelike experiences (permadeath, turn-based action, etc.)

### Story

You are a bard in a D&D party. Like all bards, you have always been happy to take a supporting role and hide behind the strength of the other party members. That is, until a snowstorm seperated you from the rest of the party. You must quickly learn to use your mismatched build, your grab bag of skills and your raw bardic charm to survive independently and rejoin the party.

### Mechanics
